            <h2>Architect | Weaver</h2>
            <p>"By integrating texture, pattern, and the perception of the passage of time, Libby's work allows the viewer to feel the dynamic tension between the natural and digital worlds and to experience the stories each woven piece tells."</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Libby Raab is an architect and artist living in the San Francisco Bay Area. Not only does she work on custom residential projects, but she also explores color, texture, and pattern through her photographs and paper weavings.Libby sees weaving, like architecture, as a form of spatial expression and material experimentation. Her work explores the intersection of geometry, digital technology and nature. By hand weaving digitally manipulated original photographs, Libby creates a dialog between tradition and innovation, organic and synthetic, reality and illusion.</p>
            <p>Libby holds a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from DePauw University and a Bachelor of Architecture from the Boston Architectural College. She has been practicing architecture for over 25 years and founded Libby Raab Architecture (LRA) in 2015.Libby believes that good residential architecture should be connected, personal, and intimate, and she pursues this personal connection in her artwork. In an increasingly digital world, handmade pieces are often more engaging to the viewer and help them make a conceptual connection to the artwork.</p>
            <p>Libby's paper weavings combine ancient weaving inspirations with modern aesthetics through the use of customized patterns that attempt to compress time by compressing the future self into the present. The basic building blocks of the work are photographs of patterns found in nature, which are manipulated by adding color gradients and digital manipulations to simulate sunlight fading and create new textures.Libby intentionally erodes portions of the weave in her work and adds paper raffia to represent the passage of time and the trauma of self-healing. She is fascinated by the constant shifting of colors in relation to each other and demonstrates the dynamic changes in color by weaving strips of imagery.</p>
